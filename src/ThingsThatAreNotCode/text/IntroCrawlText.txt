The year is...
well, not entirely relevant.

But it's a year in the not-so-distant future.

Capitalism runs rampant.

People are spending their entire lives at work,
doing really dangerous, yet tedious, jobs
(the sort of jobs that they can't automate
without running the risk of the robots unionizing
because of how soul-destroying the jobs are,
and then helping the workers to enact 
Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism)
for very little or no pay.

And one such worker is a fellow named Joe.

Joe's just an ordinary worker
(well, as ordinary as you get for a button factory worker)

He moves around using arrow keys,
he presses buttons with the spacebar,
and clocks out by pressing escape,
yet he also has to deal with his momentum when moving around,
as he has no idea what traction is.

After all, the concept of traction isn't really important
when doing the very important job of working in a button factory.

After all, those buttons won't press themselves, y'know.






Just like how your spacebar won't press itself.


















But, if you'd rather stick around instead of pressing it,
I won't judge you.




























Still here?























Well then, that's some dedication.


































you're probably expecting the funny to arrive here, aren't you?
































welp, you'll have to wait for that.



























erm

























you're probably expecting an easter egg here, aren't you?

























well, there isn't one.


























it's elsewhere.


























as in 'not here'
























aight?























yeah I'm out of ideas now.
