The year is...
well, not entirely relevant.

But it's a year in the not-so-distant future.

Capitalism runs rampant.

People are spending their entire lives at work,
doing really dangerous, yet tedious, jobs
(the sort of jobs that they can't automate
without running the risk of the robots unionizing
because of how soul-destroying the jobs are,
and then helping the workers to enact 
Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism)
for very little or no pay.

And one such worker is a fellow named Joe.
